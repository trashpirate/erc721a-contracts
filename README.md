- Base: 8453 | Base sepolia: 84532
- Bsc: 56 | Bsc Testnet: 97

### Run tests
```bash
$ forge test
```

### Generate Merkle tree and proofs

1. Navigate to the `utils/merkle-tree-generator` directory
2. Place the csv file containing the list of whitelist addresses in the `data` directory
3. Run the following command to generate the merkle tree for whitelist:
    ```bash
    $ node generateTree.js <csv_filename>
    ```
4. To generate the merkle proof for a specific address run:
    ```bash
    $ node generateProof.js <address>
    ```
For deployment, paste the merkle root into the `.env` file.
